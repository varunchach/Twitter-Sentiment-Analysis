# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Data consists of Tweets corresponding to Indian politics. They are already being classified as positive,negative and neutral. 
Our aim is to build a machine learning model to classify the tweets coming in future.

I have taken help of 3 Machine learning models namely Logistic regression , XGBoost Classifier and RandomForest and F1-Score as metric to assess.
Logistic came out to be the best model.
